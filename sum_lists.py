"""
add sum list

2 linked lists of 2 reversed numbers. each node has one digit. write an algorithm to add

adding 2 numbers require starting at the last digits. hence, we don't have to reverse the 2 linked lists. we only need to reverse the result linked list

modulo works for all nodes. no need to distinguish the location of the carrying digit
