"""
write code to partition a linked list around a value x such that all nodes 
less than x come before x and all nodes greater than x are on the right

if x is within the linked list, x can be anywhere in the right partition 

tips:
    
    use 2 linked lists, one with values less than x and one with values that are equal to or greater than x
    iterate through the entire linked list

- randomly add one node in front of another. then assemble the list without initialization
